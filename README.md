Skript but it's better and I made it.

## How does it work?
*ViperScript* is an indepentend java-based compiler that will read your "*.vpsc*" files and run them when your server starts!
When ViperScript starts, all of the newly compiled ".vpsc" will be first compiled into "*.vpsco* files, which stands for "ViperScript Object".
These files will be then compiled into java bytecode and will be activated. More is explained in the following diagram

## Standards
ViperScript requires at least Java JDK version 8. It is planned for late 2021 for ViperScript to move
to Java version 11 in order to use newer features and hopefully achieve more performance.
